3D Model
--------

  The 3D model has been made from values found into the datasheet. Some missing
values have been found on real component using vernier caliper. The 3D has been
drawn using FreeCAD (0.13).

  To use this model into kicad, a data convertion is needed. The Freecad source
has been exported to STL file and then imported to Wings 3D (1.4.1). The colors
and materials has been set into this file. Finally, wings project has been
exported to VRML. This wrl file can be used with kicad.

Note : For a unknown reason (for me, at this time :) ) a VRML export from Freecad
doesn't works into Kicad.
